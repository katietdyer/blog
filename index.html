    <h2>GOALS</h2>
    <p>
      The decision to sign up for this class was, admittedly, not a tough one:
      <ol>
        <li>I had previous interest in programming.</li>
        <li>My day job's footing the bill, and you really can't beat that.</li>
        <li>It's not like I do anything cool on Monday and Wednesday nights anyway.</li>
      </ol>
      I'd like to use these lessons as a launching point for more challenging code classes. My ultimate goal is to transition smoothly into the Full Stack Javascript course.

      <i>Wish me luck.</i>

    <h2>CONCERNS ABOUT LEARNING HTML</h2>
    <p>
      I have a good grasp of the basics, which comes from mostly self-taught trial and error. What I find the most daunting right now is learning how to code cleanly and efficiently. It's a process I very much need to incorporate, but have yet to really nail down.
